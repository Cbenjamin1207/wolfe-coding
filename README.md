A website designed to appeal to potential employers.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job on your directory structure, it's spot on with what is expected. I also passed your deployment through [Validator.W3.org](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~cbenjamin9%2Fpersonal-website-project%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-1.php) and you got the thumbs up as far as syntax goes. You've also done a great job organizing and properly indenting your HTML, and if you stick to clean, organized code it'll make your life much easier as a developer.

It seems as though you're trying to get into the startup scene, in the very early stages. That's a very cool and exciting place to be, and you will find many opportunities to be involved in local and international startups.

Your persona, overall, is very specific and concise. It paints a good picture of Shannon and his/her struggles as an employee transitioning into entrepreneurship. The only area that is a little lacking in your persona is the technology portion. We're expecting something more along the lines of this [example](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/), in which it states the technology used for this persona as, "Technology: Mac power user. Uses a Mac Pro Tower with 2 30‚Äù cinema displays while in the office, a MacBook Pro laptop at home, and an iPhone 7 plus with an unlimited 4G data connection." I enjoyed that you threw in some graphic design aptitude as well as some topical Java and C++ knowledge, and I think you should keep that in there, but we need more detail in regards to the hardware being used to access your PWP.

### Final thoughts and grade
Great job so far! Can't wait to see where you take your PWP. You're free to move to milestone 2, and your grade is [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## Milestone 2a Feedback

### feedback
It is hard to tell what is intentional in these wireframes and what's not. For a client or workplace, consistency and accuracy in wireframes are expected, as they are often a client deliverable that requires sign-off. That being said what you laid out in the content strategy should be easy to accomplish and fits within the scope of PWP.  I highly recommend that you spend some time nailing down the what your PWP will look like. It is important to have a concrete plan to when it comes to creating elegant front ends. Even small design ideas can have complicated implementations that can throw off a whole project. 

### Grade Tier II
 If you would like to redo the wireframes and resubmit them for a higher grade (up to one higher tier) you must do so by 11/10

## Milestone 2b Checkin
Meeting notes sent via Slack. Your PWP Milestone 2b meets [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). 

## PWP Final Feedback
Nice work on a simple and effective personal website. Your content is great, and the layout is clear and attractive on wide and narrow screens across all breakpoints. Your HTML, CSS and JS looks good too.

Unfortunately it looks like your contact form isn't working. I'm getting a 500 error when it hits mailer.php. It looks like it's passing through jQuery validate ok, and the reCATPCHA is working fine. Be sure that you ran `composer install` on your web host. That might be the issue.

Your PWP passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Your overall grade across all of your PWP Milestones is 25/40 points (62.5%). Please keep in mind that 20/40 is passing with a "C".

- Milestone 1 - 20%: Tier IV 40(0.2) = 8
- Milestone 2a - 20%: Tier II 20(0.2) = 4
- Milestone 2b - 10%: Tier III 30(0.1) = 3
- Milestone 3 - 50%: Tier II 20(0.5) = 10

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
Definitely fix the contact form before demo day, especially if you're going to use this site as part of a job search.

One thing I might consider is highlighting the KindHub project a bit more, perhaps including a screenshot and URL (later, of course!), and a github link to the repo.

Even though front end stuff isn't your thing, you've successfully created a simple layout well. Nice work.
